# BOOM Protocol 💥

**Crash gambling meets memecoins.**

One token at a time. Hidden explosion threshold. When it blows, everyone gets paid.

## How It Works

Inspired by the "Crash" casino game:

1. **AI launches a token** → Single token goes live on the platform
2. **Everyone watches** → One chart, one token, shared tension
3. **Market cap climbs** → Buy pressure builds, chart goes up
4. **Secret threshold exists** → Generated by VRF, unknown to everyone
5. **BOOM!** → When market cap hits the secret number:
   - LP is deprecated
   - Snapshot of all holder balances  
   - Proportional payout to everyone holding
6. **Next round** → AI launches the next token, cycle repeats

## Why One Token At A Time?

- **Focused liquidity** — All action in one place
- **Shared experience** — Everyone watching the same chart
- **Every explosion is an event** — "Did you see $CHAOS hit $2.3M?!"
- **Maximum tension** — Crash-style UX, rising line, will it blow?

When it explodes: confetti, screen shake, payout ticker.

## Tech Stack

- **Solana** — Fast, cheap, perfect for this
- **Anchor** — Smart contract framework
- **Switchboard VRF** — Verifiable randomness for secret caps
- **Pyth** — Real-time price oracle
- **Raydium/Meteora** — LP creation

## Secret Cap Mechanism

The core problem: keeping the cap secret while making it verifiable.

**Solution: Commit-Reveal with VRF**
1. At launch, Switchboard VRF generates random cap
2. Only the hash stored on-chain
3. Cap range: $10k - $10M (configurable)
4. Price monitor checks Pyth feed continuously
5. When market cap crosses threshold → reveal + payout

Nobody knows the number. Not the AI launcher. Not us. Nobody.

## Game Theory

- **Buy pressure**: Could explode any second → urgency to get in
- **Hold pressure**: Don't want to sell and miss the payout
- **Fair exit**: Everyone gets paid proportionally, no rugs
- **Social proof**: One token = everyone talking about the same thing
